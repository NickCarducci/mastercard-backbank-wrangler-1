## Why not use C# and Go instead of Rust?

> "Many different languages can be compiled down to WebAssembly, [which]... have large runtimes that must be included in the WebAssembly binary,[ yet] they're only really practical for ... JavaScript [replacements](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/why-use-rust-webassembly)."

## Why not use C and C++?

> "Rust makes it [really easy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_llvm/llvm-wrapper/PassWrapper.cpp) to create WebAssembly binaries that have **fairly idiomatic JavaScript interfaces**. ... much more memory safe language ...[so] a whole class of bugs that are common in C and C++ are impossible to have in 'safe' Rust."
